\section{Introduction}

While gene expression profiling is commonly used to gain an overview of cellular processes, the identification of upstream processes that drive expression changes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce \emph{CARNIVAL}~\cite{CARNIVAL}, a causal network contextualization tool which derives network architectures from gene expression footprints. \emph{CARNIVAL} (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming)(see \url{https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL/}) integrates different sources of prior knowledge including signed and directed proteinâ€“protein interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures.

\subsection{CARNIVAL pipeline}

CARNIVAL refines a quantitative objective function for ILP problem by incorporating TF and pathway activities on a continuous scale. In addition, the CARNIVAL framework allows us to contextualize the network with or without known targets of perturbations. The implementation is separated into two pipelines which will be referred henceforth as Standard CARNIVAL \emph{StdCARNIVAL} (with known perturbation targets as an input) and Inverse CARNIVAL \emph{InvCARNIVAL} (without information on targets of perturbation), see Figure \ref{fig:carnival_pipeline}. The differential gene expression is used to infer transcription factor (TF) activities with DoRothEA, which are subsequently discretized in order to formulate ILPconstraints. As a result, CARNIVAL derives a family of highest scoring networks which best explain theinferred TF activities. Continuous pathway and TF activities can be additionally considered in the objective function.

\subsection{ILP solvers}
\emph{CARNIVAL} is an extension of the previously implemented Causal Reasoning method from Melas et al.~\cite{Melas}.The network inference process is swiftly performed with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of causal reasoning using two solvers: the open-source mixed integer programming solver \emph{Cbc} (Coin-or branch and cut)(see \url{https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc}); or the \emph{CPLEX optimizer} from \emph{IBM} (see \url{https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer}) which can be obtained for free through the Academic Initiative. To perform the analysis, the users will then need to store the binary \emph{cbc} or \emph{cplex} executables on any directory they wish. The binary files of \emph{cbc} can be found by first downloading one of the optimization suites provided here: \url{https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OptimizationSuite/}, unzip the download and from there save the \emph{cbc} executable (which can be found on the \emph{bin} directory) file on any of the direcotries they wish of their machines. As for the \emph{cplex}, after registration on the \emph{ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio} here: \url{https://my15.digitalexperience.ibm.com/b73a5759-c6a6-4033-ab6b-d9d4f9a6d65b/dxsites/151914d1-03d2-48fe-97d9-d21166848e65/technology/data-science}. Samilar like before, users will have to find the \emph{cplex} executable binary file and save on a directory of their own wish.
